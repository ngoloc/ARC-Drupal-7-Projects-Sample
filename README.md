ARC-Drupal-7-Projects-Sample
============================

These are three main PHP/Drupal7 projects I have worked on at ARC - Portland State University since June 15th 2012 - September 20th 2013.

The Oregon Encyclopedia Project (since June 15th 2011):
The purpose of the Oregon Encyclopedia (OE) is to provide a free service to the public that provides access to articles based on topics pertaining to Oregon. The OE may be used as an educational reference to students and teachers, a source of information for researchers, or a place to learn for an interested individual.
