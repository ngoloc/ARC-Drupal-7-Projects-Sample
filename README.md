ARC-Drupal-7-Projects-Sample
============================

These are three main PHP/Drupal7 projects I have worked on at ARC - Portland State University since June 15th 2012 - September 20th 2013.

<b>The Oregon Encyclopedia Project (since June 15th 2011)</b><br/>
The purpose of the Oregon Encyclopedia (OE) is to provide a free service to the public that provides access to articles based on topics pertaining to Oregon. The OE may be used as an educational reference to students and teachers, a source of information for researchers, or a place to learn for an interested individual.

<b>VCP Video Coding Project</b><br/>
The Regional Research Institute (RRI) is currently engaged in several research projects whose data is derived from scoring video based interviews. The methodology is sound; however, the process by which the scoring is done can be improved upon. This document outlines the ARC's proposed improvements for RRI's AMP project.

<b>EV Road Map</b><br/>
The goal of the EV Roadmap is to make people aware of Oregon's partnership with Portland General Electric, eTec, and Nissan North America to deploy up to 4,700 zero-emission electric vehicles and 11,210 charging systems. The EV Roadmap will also provide users with tools that can help them decide to buy into the electric vehicle revolution.
